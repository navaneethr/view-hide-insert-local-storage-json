# view-hide-insert-local-storage-json
I got the data from JSON file and stored it in Local Storage to later show it in a table format which has a button "View" in each row, and when you press it extra information can be seen and when you press it the second time it hides (did not use the jQuery Toggle function), you can add data to local storage ass well and delete it if you want to.

//Application Update..

Application loads JSON data and stores it in a tabular format and when you click on view button it shows extra information about the respective person. It also hides the extra information. However adding new data to the Local Storage has not been done yet.
